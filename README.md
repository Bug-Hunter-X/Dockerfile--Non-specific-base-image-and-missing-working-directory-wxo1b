This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles: the use of a generic base image and the lack of a working directory.  The `Dockerfile` shows the problematic code, while `Dockerfile-solution` provides the corrected version.  The problem is that unspecified working directories, combined with a non-specific image, can lead to issues with file paths and dependency installation.
